OneClick AI is a NANDA‑inspired “Internet of Agents” that turns a single intent — like “build a Ferrari” or “source a fridge” — into a coordinated supply plan. Today, supply chains still rely on manual discovery, email negotiation, and brittle integrations. We built an agent‑native network where independent buyer, supplier, logistics, and compliance agents can discover each other, negotiate terms, and execute a plan through structured messages.

During the hackathon we built: (1) an agent registry with identity + capability facts, (2) a coordination cascade that decomposes a product into components, discovers real supplier candidates via RapidAPI product search, negotiates bids, and validates logistics/compliance, and (3) a live D3 supply graph that visualizes components, suppliers, and routes alongside an agent message feed. The system produces concrete artifacts such as a supply graph snapshot and a JSONL message feed that can be audited or replayed.

This benefits procurement teams, manufacturers, and logistics operators who need faster sourcing under uncertainty. The demo already works end‑to‑end with real‑time data sources and a deterministic offline mode for reliability. The result is a programmable supply chain workflow that is transparent, interoperable, and demo‑ready.
